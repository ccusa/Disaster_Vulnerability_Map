# Catholic Charities USA Disaster Vulnerability Map


## Purpose
CCUSA wanted to create a map to **better target mitigation, preparedness, relief, and recovery projects** in order to best serve communities that are both at greatest risk for disasters and most overlooked or outright excluded from federal assistance during disasters. Specifically, they wanted to see the presence of acutely vulnerable populations such as uninsured (homeowners or renters), homeless, or subsidized renters at the local level.

## Data
This map uses data from the CDC’s [Social Vulnerability Index](https://svi.cdc.gov) and a proprietary dataset which maps disaster risk that we were given permission to use.

From the CDC’s website, social vulnerability refers to the resilience of communities when confronted by external stresses on human health, stresses such as natural or human-caused disasters, or disease outbreaks. Reducing social vulnerability can decrease both human suffering and economic loss. ATSDR's Social Vulnerability Index uses U.S. census variables at tract level to help local officials identify communities that may need support in preparing for hazards, or recovering from disaster.

The proprietary dataset shows risk of six types of natural disasters: floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados, wildfires, and hail. It uses data from FEMA, USGS, and NOAA.

## Convert data into Vector Tiles
The data was converted from a shape file into vector tiles, due to the size of the data. Please see the ShapefileCreation file to view how the file was converted.
