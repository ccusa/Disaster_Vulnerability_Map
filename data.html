       Two data sources are used in the Disaster Operations Map.
       First, the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) is a public data base curated by the Center for Disease Control (CDC).
       Second, te Natural Hazard Housing Risk Index is a proprietary data set released by ATTOM Data Solutions.

                We pull the data we need from these files and bring them into a .mbtiles file to use with Mapbox and D3.js. Full methodology on this data manipulation is available on the <a href="https://github.com/ccusa/Disaster_Vulnerability_Map" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
 page.

                <br><br>

                The Overall Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) is a composite score of four broad vulnerability indicators: Socioeconomic Status, Household Composition, Minority Status/Language, and Housing and Transportation.
                Each sub-category is calculated from specific indicators described in the table below.

                <br><br>
                Index scores range from 0 to 1; which depicts the percentiles of a particular county or tract relative to the rest of the USA.
                The higher the percentile ranking, the more vulnerable an area is in that category. A red flag indicates that an area is highly vulnerable, or in the top 90th percentile of a particular vulnerability.

                The Hazard Risk is an additive composite of six measures: Hurricane, Flood, Earthquake, Wildfire, Tornado, and Hail.
                Each hazard risk component is measured on a scale from 0-60, with a potential Overall Hazard Risk of 360.
